### Specialist Perks
- spec perks are now disabled from this version onwards

- they're still in legends so we don't break compatibility and some of their effects will make their way on other perks
- you also might see it in a submod ;)

Item refactors:

```

Added a new way of defining outfit variants: for example [1, "vanity/legend_helmet_southern_noble_crown", [1,2,3]], where variants can be now defined as an array.

A number of armor name refactors and normalization to use the same value in the name field and the .pngs, removing the brush field and separating
items that used the same brush name into standalone definitions. Note that items marked as 'separated' have their variant numbering restarted from 1.
The .pngs have also gone necessary changes, see the link below for more details (includes removal of bust_ prefix).
For clarity, legend_armor is prefixed at make_legends_armor level and should be referenced as such while building outfits.
Description changes for both armors and helmets.
Added named helmet bases support.
Refactored vanity_lower -> vanity in outfits and lowervanity defs field to lower, IsLower to Lower, created IsLower() helper function.
Lower layers are now available for helms and masks.
The display ordering is as follows:
VanityLower -> VanityLower2 -> Head -> Helmet -> HelmLower -> TopLower -> Helm -> Top -> Vanity -> Vanity2
Chain, Plate, Tabard and Cloak layers are now displayed on bodies.
Base, Chain, Helm, Vanity layers are now displayed on bodies.
Added template definition for armor's brush_only_layers to define armors with custom size via front/back sprites.
Changed named helmet and armor fields to an object for better readability (for armor min and max CON have been reversed, so both helmets and armor work the same way).
